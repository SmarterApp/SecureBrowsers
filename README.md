# SecureBrowsers
Secure Browsers lock down the computer or device while the student takes a test.

SmarterApp offers secure browsers for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, ChromeBook, and Android. Source code for the secure browsers is located at [https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss). This is a placeholder repository primarly for the purpose of collecting **issues** (bug reports and enhancement requests) that will guide development starting in July 2015.
